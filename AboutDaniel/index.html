      <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V63M3x_qF3A"> The Spaniel Myth </a> was born on July 4th, 1776. The most important day in history. He was named after George Washington's nickname, Daniel Smith. On Daniel's second day alive, he pointed out a large white sphere above the Earth. This was later referred to as the moon. Then, Daniel noticed a very bright light shining down. He was the first person to point out the sun. Later on, he discovered a liquid that was very beneficial to humans. This is the first recorded case of someone drinking water. Later, after getting a new nickname, Daniel successfuly became the 16h President in American History. </p>
